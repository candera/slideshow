# slideshow

Shows a full-screen slideshow of all the images in a directory tree. 

## Usage

Call the function slideshow, passing in a directory. Alternatively,
use the included launch4j config file to generate a Windows
executable, and run that with a directory as an argument. 

## Installation

FIXME: write

## TODO

* Fix the fact that the app doesn't terminate.
* Add indicators for when it's paused, rotation speed, etc.
* Hide cursor
* Add support for showing text from a file instead of just images
