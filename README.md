# slideshow

Shows a full-screen slideshow of all the images in a directory tree.

use the included launch4j config file to generate a Windows
executable, and run that with a directory as an argument. 

## Installation

## TODO

* Adjust when resized or moved across monitors
** This looks like it's working now - test it out on Lorien
* Bind q and ESC to quit
* Add indicators for when it's paused, rotation speed, etc.
* Hide cursor after it stops moving for a few seconds
* Center text in flashcard mode
